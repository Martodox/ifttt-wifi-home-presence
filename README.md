# ifttt-wifi-home-presence

This is a nodejs project aimed at showing how to connect [ifttt](https://ifttt.com/) 
with your local code in order to produce automated home behaviour.

This particular code will trigger an on or off event based on a list of devices connected 
to a local network (wifi). Best run on raspberry pi or similar low power device.
